## Features

### Automated Daily Commit

Help two "grass hoppers (🐸 - 🦗)" become friends, and enjoy planting the grass on your github profile. 

This project includes a github-actions workflow: `GRASSHOPPERS`, which simply commits a change to the text file: [./grass/grass.txt](./grass/grass.txt).

-at specific times, and everyday.

### Scheduling 

>  You can schedule a workflow to run at specific UTC times using [POSIX cron syntax](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07). Scheduled workflows run on the latest commit on the default or base branch. The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every 5 minutes. [Reference→](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events)

As described above, you can also customize its running interval of `GRASSHOPPERS`. Edit the contents in [grasshoppers.yml](./.github/workflows/grasshoppers.yml).
